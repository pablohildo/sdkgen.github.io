# Common Issues

## Requests aren't received when using WSL2

### Observed Issue

Although `new SdkgenHttpServer.listen(port)` is being called and outputs `Listening on :::PORT` or similar to console, no connection can be established. Hence, no requests are received.

### Resolution

WSL2 ports aren't always forwarded. Two solutions are appliable:
- Use a default forwarded port (`3000` is most likely one of those);
- Add a new port forwarding rule that includes the port you're using. Remember to also add this rule to Firewall Rules, otherwise it's probably going to be blocked.

### Additional Information

This is a known issue with WSL2 as seen on it's [official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150). The reason this happens is WSL2 uses a completely new network system architecture, "changing from the default bridged network adapter to a hyper-v virtual network adapter". You can find more Information [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723).
